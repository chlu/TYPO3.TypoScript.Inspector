TYPO3 TypoScript Inspector
==========================

Chrome Extension
----------------

To install the Chrome extension from source, please follow these steps:

* Go to chrome://extensions in your Browser
* Enable developer mode
* Click "Load unpacked extension" and choose the directory Resources/Private/Chrome in this package

Once the extension is installed, you should have a new panel in the developer tools.
If you open this panel on a page rendered by TypoScript with enabled debug mode,
you should get a tree outline of the rendered TypoScript objects.
